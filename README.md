Welcome to the School Landing Page project! In this project, we have designed and created a captivating landing page for a brand new school using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The provided wireframe served as our foundation, allowing us to focus on the page's layout and flow.

## Project Overview
Creating an effective landing page is crucial for any educational institution. It's the first point of contact for potential students, parents, and other stakeholders. Our goal was to design a clean, user-friendly, and informative landing page that introduces the school, highlights its unique features, and encourages further exploration.


## Technologies Used

CSS,
Bootstrap


## Wireframe
The wireframe provided a strategic blueprint, indicating the positioning of elements on the page. By separating layout planning from design choices, It helps us to maintain a strong focus on the user experience and information hierarchy.
